                <p>Nineteen Eighty-Four (also stylised as 1984) is a dystopian social science fiction novel and cautionary tale 
                    written by English writer George Orwell. It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth 
                    and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, it centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass 
                    surveillance and repressive regimentation of people and behaviours within society.[2][3] Orwell, a democratic 
                    socialist, modelled the totalitarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany.[2][3][4] 
                    More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated.
